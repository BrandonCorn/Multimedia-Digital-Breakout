            &emsp;The gang has made it safely to Breckenridge to meet up with Lilly and man is it cold. Right now, Lilly is at a checkpoint cabin down the mountain. The way this mountain’s ski lift operates,
            you can get from the bottom to the top of the mountain in one ride, but to get to the different checkpoint cabins you have to take the ski lifts at the top down certain paths. Since we’re learning
            about data structures let’s say we talk about Binary Trees while we make our way up and down the mountain to Lilly.

                linked data structure made up of nodes. The nodes on the tree each contain a reference to a left node and right node. The root node is the tip top of the tree and if it connects to a
                node on the left and the right, these are its children. These nodes are connected to their root by directed edges, so the node above them they are connected to is their parent. Nodes
                connected to the same parent are known as siblings and nodes with no children are known as leaves. The depth of a tree is the number of directed edges from the root (which is the top)
                to the tree’s leaves (which are the nodes at the bottom with no children). If one side of the tree has more parent nodes than the other side, then it has more depth.

              <p>
                Let’s say we have a tree put together with 4 letters, A,B,C, and D. A is the root node so it’s at the top. B is the left child of A and C is the right child of A, so B and C are A’s children
                while A is the parent. Now D is the left child of B and is at the bottom of that side of the tree which makes it a leaf. On the right side of the tree, C is a leaf node because it also has no
                children. If you can’t tell, the left side of the tree has more depth than the right because we have one edge from A to B and one edge from B to D. The right side has one edge from A to C. This
                is a binary tree in its simplest form.

            <p>
              is we can use different forms for different things. There are Decision trees, AVL trees, and Binary Search Trees to name a few which all operate differently in the
              way we add, delete, and traverse the nodes. The mountain we’re on is similar to a decision tree, in that if we decide to visit the checkpoint cabins down the left
              side of the mountain, from there we can only go down to the cabins connected to that side. The cabins on the right side don’t have connections to the ones on the right
              so we have to take each ski lift from the checkpoints going down either right or left from each one to reach Lilly. Before moving on, take a look at the resource link
              to learn some more about binary trees and their different forms.
